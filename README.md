# Attribution Interest Group

## Rationale

This interest group is a collaboration between TDWG and the Research Data Alliance to enhance existing and create new standards for giving attribution for the maintenance, curation, and digitization of physical and digital objects with a special emphasis on biodiversity collections. This group will produce use cases from a variety of disciplines that will be used to create the final deliverable â€“ an attribution metadata schema.
